### Will create a todo web app using React.js, Material UI (MUI), Firebase, i luv MUI, it good, really good, too good

### Almost 5 days to this project and i have learned a tone, worked alot with props and different React hooks, used props to create call-back functions and worked with Firebase Firestore Database, learned how to start Collections, add Documents, and modify its fields.

### Performed CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with React + Firebase

### when it comes to React concepts, worked with useEffect to fetch the data as the website loads, and worked with its dependency array to fetch data again as the state of application changes.

### there are still alot that can be done to make the webapp even better such as uploading files to each todo as i have the field being created for it on creating each to do, adding a due date as i have created its component for it, and soo many other things, the sky is the limit at this point. however i have decided to move on with a new project for now, u never know, maybe i come back and add more functionalities to this project later.
